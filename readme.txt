Title - Roadly

According to us, we have classified the users into 3 categories namely Government officials, Contractors and Public which will have separate platforms based on their respective roles.



Description of folders - 


1) Contractor Platform :

The Contractors would be able to login with the help of the key provided by the government officials. They can see all the reports that were reported by the people for various issues on the road. They will be responsible for updating the status of the reported issue reported by the people. Their rating will be affected by the number of unresolved reports.



2) Government Officials Platform :

The Government Officials would be able to select location on map and assigned road to contractors of their choice and keep track of the quality of roads which were given to some contractor. Based on the reports that are reported by the people, the government officials will be able to keep a track of the maintenance that will be required for that reported road. They will be able to see the ratings of the contractors and can give new contracts to contractors who have a higher ratings. In case of lease, the contractor will have to upload the video of the road or part of it which is completed in order for the government officials to verify it. After verification, they can make it operational for the public. They can assign if a road is under construction or maintenance in order for the public to know.



3) Public Crowdsource Platform :

The Public are the most important part of our platform for crowdsourcing. They will have the option to report any problems or issues they feel is present on the road. They can report the issue for a road only if they are within some fixed distance from the road that they are reporting. The user need not mark exactly on the road as the marker will automatically pick the road closest to the place where the marker will be marked. While reporting the road, they will also have an option to add a description about the problem that they had faced. If some road is not named by the government officials then they can not report that road as no contractor was responsible for it. They will get some points when they have successfully reported an issue. The points will be randomly allocated to them.They will be able to see the live leaderboard of people. They can see the status for their respective reports. They can see the number of total reported issues and how many have been resolved.
